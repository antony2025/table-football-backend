# The table football scores tracker - REST API

REST API to store and display table football scores so the people know who is the champion!

This project is intended to be used with the [Table Football Front-End](https://github.com/antony2025/table-football-ui).

## Dependencies

The API uses MongoDB Atlas for storing the data.

Since it is an Online Archive, you do not have to install anything local.

The connection string with username and password is hard-coded, therefore, it should work out of the box.

In case, the app is not able to connect to the database, please email me the error message and I would troubleshoot it.
